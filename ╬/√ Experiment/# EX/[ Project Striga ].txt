real niggas remember /i/ and partyvanwiki

moid.org/ed. An old site that had a forum and a folder full of fucked up shit like psphacked.jpg and gore.

http://worlds.com/
second life also has some wierd places. its basicaly a slightly more modern worlds

op. EVERY, and i mean _EVERY_ fucking time a fringe site gets posted here, trannies, poltards or just glow niggers ruin it, and it gets shutdown.
find them yourself, or just appreciate from a distance. theyre rare now, or make your own. but so im not just being a dick, here

Miles Mathis. He has a math and science site that I can't comment on but also an "art site" which is mostly where he publishes PDFs containing stuff like
> Every serial killer was a psi-op
> Most authors of popular fiction are actors, the books are written by glowies
> Most happenings, shootings, deaths etc are fake and gay
> Celebrities all fake their deaths
He's an entertaining writer, which helps.
I'll also recommend Dylan Groves on Youtube (one old account and one current one, watch the old one), MK Ultra and satanic abuse survivor

Been here the whole time.
I would expect you would have to either have an extremely well connected friend or start out from the beginning. Go to r/trackers, but there are probably better places. I would search through the chan archives.
>What is a private tracker?
>A private tracker is a tracker that will require you have a membership in order to access the torrent files.
>Advantages will differ by site, but they often include better quality control, retention, security and organization. Disadvantages are needing to get an account in order to use the site and often being required to seed for a minimum time and/or maintain ratio via seeding.
As you can see, you’re not getting in this shit without a lot of time invested. This is how they winnow out glowies and idiots, because if you can make it into these sites you have already qualified yourself.
But I expect there’s some pretty exclusive rewards - it could be a retarded elitist club of nobodies coping with their irrelevance, or some legitimately interesting people with lots to share. Probably both, in different places

my most coveted sites took half a decade based on buildign a reputation online. If you want to join, you can absolutely can, it just wont be spoon fed to you.
What you need to do is, if you are serious, is joing a quasi private tracker, very easy to find. Amass a library of obscure media, or rip your local library etc so you can contribute. The typical route to surive on trackers is to seed pr0n for a buffer.
When i first got axx (scene different from trackers) it was bc i was moderating a forum back in 06. Basically just making connections and back then leaks were a thing, not so much now, think biggest leak was GoT eps in recent memory but i digress.
If you want to learn how to encode, compress videos etc you will be an asset to most sites. Just remember its a thankless job and almost every new piece of media is better off with a web-dl or UHD remux.
Im rambling but the point is hoard your media, learn how to create/seed torrents, learn IRC and be patient. Were i to start my journy now I would be on twitter and reddit to network. Piracy and data hoarding has just proven to be the superior method in every single facet. Its time zoomers drop apps and start downloading and building servers. Enough fun and games

This thread and the doompost screenshots has got me thinking about radio wave internet. Or a parasitic overlay on top of existing social media, trading messages in private messages and public messages with steganography in images. People always talk about "the big 6" social media but the top 100 websites with posting features would act as a good enough 'backend' for a distributed cyberpunk network. Wouldn't be difficult to implement, you'd just need to define some protocol and code up a shit ton of convenience features so that people would actually use the damn thing. Recall that Discord brought nothing new technologically to the table, it just had a slick UI and a simple but powerful feature set. Just easier to onboard and use.

And if you hid messages in youtube vides, with yt-dl it'd be relatively simple to set up.
Over the years people have done various steganography in 4chan images, with the main purpose of adding (URL's of) audio clips to images. Most recent one was from /g/'s coom general, lmao. They got shut down so mods caught on eventually, I wasn't following events.

In a way, the answer to OP's question is the ultimate secret websites/chats would be steganography secret networks that probably already exist, although I'm not sure if anyone would use them for non-academic or silly use cases. If you're a criminal or schizo, you have other options rather than relying on some bug-prone janky software that encrypts and distributes your messages across multiple social media / email sites.
(Wouldn't even need steganography per se, you just split your msg into 5 parts and private msg your contact on their 5 different social media sites, email, etc.)

I'm hoping that the new wave of distributed and peer-to-peer stuff becomes more interesting.
I feel the doom but I think we can build robust systems with new tech. Normies on desktops (not phones) will be left in the dark, and I genuinely think that's a loss, but the smart ones will figure it out eventually
