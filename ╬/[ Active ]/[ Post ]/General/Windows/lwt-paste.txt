/lwt/ Legacy Windows Thread Thread paste no.1 - will be tweaked accordingly with new info and tools

Remmber to post the thread number, usually found in the first few posts of the previous thread.

OP:
Feel free to share any tips and tricks here on using Windows past its EoL date, such as alternative browsers and ways to bypass software artificially blocking legacy Windows systems.
Post your projects, devices, and setups.

Remember, Windows 10 and 11 are user hostile operating systems.

Installing Windows 7 from scratch:
1. Grab the latest Simplix updatepack torrent here: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:220BC5F3B03D831115DF2958885EDC165E45043A
2. Grab yer Win7 ISO of your choice from: https://massgrave.dev/windows_7_links.html
3. Drag yer Windows7.ISO onto the Simplix.exe file. It will integrate all updates, including NVME, and USB3 drivers into it. Learn some pirate tunes, it'll take a while.
4. Prepare a USB Flash Disquette with Ventoy and copy the patched .ISO file to it. Rufus also works 
5. Boot & install! Talk like a pirate while yer' doin' it! ARRRR!!!
