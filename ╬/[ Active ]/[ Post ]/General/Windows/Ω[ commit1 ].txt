NTA, but you'd either have to use EzWindSLIC (UEFI-GPT) or Daz's Windows Loader (if BIOS/CSM-MBR)
>>95192879
Wondering if you can include these following info in the paste:
>>94820250 (Slim down list of activation-related scripts to the essentials)
>>94884189 (GameUX.dll and old games depending on the DLL's shims failing to launch)
>>95056309 → >>95058184 → (About backported Win10 telemetry components and updates containing them)
In addition, to the Vista and XP sections:
-I'd rather give Ramsey's XP Integral Edition (formerly Black Edition) a mention, and remove the rest of these random XP homebrews from paste.

>inb4 XP-IE's also a rando homebrew
Not really that much of a rando. Ramsey/LuxLOL's been doing it since 2008-ish, as far as I can tell. Should be trusted.
-Give harkaz's Unofficial Service Pack 4 a mention, if somebody wants to update an XP install or ISO by himself
https://msfn.org/board/topic/171171-introducing-unofficial-windows-xp-sp4
-Mention Legacy Update (brings back Windows Update client functionability for legacy Windows systems)
also contains an archive of Microsoft's Download Center before most of the stuff got removed due to the SHA-2 transitioning in August 2020

-Remove the online activation mention for Vista (don't really like how one has to rely on external random activation servers)
EzWindSlic/Daz's Windows Loader should work fine with them, alternatively KMS-VL-ALL (not to be mistaken with abbodi's KMS_VL_ALL, of which is a fork of the earlier)

BTW, i'd rather use these ISOs instead, for Vista, as they are fully updated:
