http://www.catborg/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html is a good start, its not lates catt developments, more like reading plato so you have a background to build on. Once you're comfortable and made touch with a few friends and have a help network, dive in, install a *BSD or Linux distribution, remember to read the manpages and docs, and have fun.
