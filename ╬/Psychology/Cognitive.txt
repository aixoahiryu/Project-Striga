[COGNITIVE DISSONANCE]
Cognitive dissonance is a psychological concept that refers to the discomfort or tension experienced by an individual when they hold conflicting beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors. This theory was developed by the psychologist Leon Festinger in the late 1950s and has since become an essential component of social psychology.
When individuals encounter inconsistencies between their thoughts, beliefs, or actions, they are motivated to reduce this dissonance to restore psychological harmony and balance. People strive for consistency in their thoughts and behaviors because inconsistency can lead to feelings of unease and mental discomfort.
